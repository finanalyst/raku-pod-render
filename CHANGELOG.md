# 2022-12-08 v4.2.0

*  default templates for footer needs changing to generate a time

*  default navigation template to remove tags if no TOC or Glossary.

*  include `add-plugins` to P2HTML2 so that new plugins can added to the distributed ones.

# 2022-11-27 v4.1.1
*  improve unknown-name default template

*  improve default templates

# correct

Samples.rakudoc for image

# 2022-11-15 v4.1.0
*  allow for data object to be rewritten by add-plugin. Use case: the name-space for a plugin needs to be available for the plugin's callables, as it contains config data needed by plugin callables

*  Created a Samples.rakudoc file for Rakudoc-to-html Example

*  rewrote sample plugins for HTML2 from Collection variants.

*  wrote new core plugin move-assets for HTML2 to mimic Collection render milestone functionality

*  rewrote BUILD.pm to copy all plugins from resources to a local default directory

*  basic node2html and pod2html options tested. Uses Rakuclosure, so no mustache options.

# 2022-10-x v4-0-0
*  Refactor HTML2 to

	*  rely on and accept custom plugins

	*  remove all template reliant tests to Pod-Render folder

	*  introduce Rakudoc-to-html utility to render a single Rakudoc file to html into current directory

*  Change name of MarkDown to MarkDown2

*  Change params of Link FormatCode. Now both local and internal may have targets, the template must handle both. The character # designating a target must be added by a template. Before there was a flag defining local/internal/external, a parameter for contents, and a parameter for target (the file | page name). Now there is an extra parameter `location` defining the location inside the file|page.

*  rename mandatory template `named` tp `unknown-name`, which is called when an unknown named Pod::Block is used.

*  refactor modify-templates for plugins, in order to allow for multiple templating in plugins.

	*  A plugin template file may evaluate to a hash of hashes if the key `RakuClosureTemplater` (case insensitive) exists as a first level key

	*  Each primary key then refers to a templating engine,

	*  the second level keys are the template names.

	*  a plugin's templates are only added to the instance of ProcessedPod using `modify-templates`

	*  when `modify-templates` is called for a plugin, it checks whether the default `RakuClosureTemplater` key is present.

		*  If so, the templates pointed to by `.templater.Str` in the plugin's templates are used, and if not present, then an Exception is thrown.

		*  If not, the plugin is using Rakuclosure templates, so if `.templater.Str` is not `RakuClosureTemplater` then an Exception is thrown

*  remove ExtractPod as Pod::Load is Raku canonical

# 2022-09-24 v3-8-0
*  allow rakudoc to be an alias to pod for a named block
