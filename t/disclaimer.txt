ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY IS IMPLIED. NOT EVEN OF ANY KIND. WE HAVE SOLD YOU THIS SOFTWARE WITH NO HINT OF A SUGGESTION THAT IT IS EITHER USEFUL OR USABLE.
AS FOR GUARANTEES OF CORRECTNESS...DON'T MAKE US LAUGH! AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE
WE MIGHT DEIGN TO SELL YOU UPGRADES THAT PURPORT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE APPLICATION'S MANY DEFICIENCIES, BUT NO PROMISES THERE EITHER.
WE HAVE MORE LAWYERS ON STAFF THAN YOU HAVE TOTAL EMPLOYEES, SO DON'T EVEN *THINK* ABOUT SUING US.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
